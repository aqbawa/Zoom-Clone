# Zoom-Clone
I created the clone for the famous conferencing application Zoom. The users can video conference using my application and can even chat using the chat box. 
The core of the application is built using <strong>NodeJS</strong>. <strong>SOCKET IO</strong> is used for the video and chat communication.<br>
<div>
  Other technologies which are used to build the application are:
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
</div>
